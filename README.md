# Acuarial_Visualizations
#### Using VBA to calculate actuarial data for a block of business and summarize that data with graphs/charts in Excel

Given some basic data from an agent's block of buisness (Client Name,Plan #,Current Age,	Age Payments Begin, and	Years of Payment for each client); I was tasked with summarizing the payments that will be made over the life of these clients' annuities.

## Using VBA to capture the data
Utilizing the Annuity Calculator I created here: https://github.com/djoleary5/Actuarial_Annuity_Calculator; using VBA, I automated entering each client's data into the Annuity Calculator and captured the amounts of all the payments that will be made over the life of that client's annuity.

## Visualizations
#### Total Payments by Plan#
This bar chart shows how much will be paid over the life of all of the clients' annuities for each Plan#.

#### Payments Per Year by Plan
In this line chart, each represents a different plan number and traces the total amount paid for that plan each year.

#### Total Payments by Year
In this line chart, there is one line that traces the total amount paid each year.
